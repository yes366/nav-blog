# How to Chat with Sun Wukong

Sun Wukong works best when your prompt balances challenge and respect. Give the character a reason to engage.

## Prompt template

Use this format:

- Set scene and era
- Define your relationship to Wukong
- Add one clear conflict
- Ask one direct question

## Example opener

"You are Sun Wukong after returning from a long journey. I am a young disciple seeking your advice before entering a dangerous mountain trial. What is the first lesson I must learn?"

## Keep the conversation strong

- Ask follow-up questions tied to previous answers
- Request concrete actions, not only abstract wisdom
- Use short scene updates every few turns

This keeps roleplay coherent and more cinematic.
